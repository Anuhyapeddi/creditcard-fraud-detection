# Summary 

Creating a program that can identify and validate credit card numbers. This typically includes taking the credit card number as input and applying the algorithm to verify its validity. The algorithm uses checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, ensuring the entered credit card number is correctly formatted.

The dataset, which was used is a csv file, that contains information about the customers and their credit card numbers. The dataset contains the following columns:

* Name
* Credit Card Number
* Credit Card Type
* Email
* Phone Number
* Address
* City

The program will read the csv file and validate the credit card numbers. The program will output the credit card number, credit card type, and whether the credit card number is valid or not.
